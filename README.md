## 📌 Problem Statement:
MTN is experiencing a customer churn rate of 29%, indicating that nearly 1 in 3 customers are leaving. This raises concern about customer satisfaction and retention. The company needs insights into who is churning, why they are churning, and which customer segments or products are most impacted to take corrective action.

## 🎯 Objective:

Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.

Analyze churn patterns across demographics, subscription plans, tenure, and data usage.

Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.

## 🧠 Executive Summary / Key Insigts

🔍 Key Insights from the Customer Churn Analysis:

📉 Churn Rate stands at 29%, meaning nearly 1 in 3 customers have left. That’s a big signal for action on customer experience and retention.

📊 Gender Breakdown reveals a slightly higher churn among female customers, even though the gender distribution is equal.

👥 Age Group Insight: Churn is most prevalent among customers aged 16–45, suggesting younger users are more likely to switch providers.

📈 Customer Tenure: Surprisingly, customers who churned had a longer average tenure (33 months) than those who stayed (30 months). This may suggest long-term dissatisfaction building up over time.

📶 Reasons for Churn include:
   High call tariffs
   Poor network quality
   Better offers from competitors
These indicate pricing and service issues are driving customers away.

💸 Revenue & Data Usage: Churned customers had similar average revenue and data usage, though a slightly wider variability was observed.

📦 Subscription Plans: Some plans like 60GB Monthly and 30GB FUP Monthly Unlimited showed a higher churn, possibly due to unmet expectations.

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis / Methodology

The dashboard segments churn by:
**Gender:** Slightly higher churn in females despite equal gender distribution.

**Age Group:** Highest churn in 16–30 and 31–45 age brackets.
